Prepare SQLAdvanced SelectBinary Tree Nodes

PROBLEM

You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.



COLUMN    TYPE

N          INT
P          INT

Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.


SAMPLE INPUT

N     P
1     2
3     2
6     8
9     8

5     NULL



SOLUTION




SELECT A.N, 
CASE 
  WHEN A.P IS NOT NULL THEN 
  CASE
   WHEN (select count(*) from bst where P=A.N)=0
   then 'Leaf'
   Else
   'Inner'
   end
 ELSE 
    'Root'
END
from BST A
ORDER BY A.N;
